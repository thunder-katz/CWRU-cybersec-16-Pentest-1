  1. Where is the company located: 
		- Sunnyvale, California, 94085.  

  2. What is the NetRange IP address:
		- 65.61.137.64 - 65.61.137.127

  3. What is the company they use to store their infrastructure:
		- Rackspace Backbone Engineering

  4. What is the IP address of the DNS server:
		- 65.61.137.117

#### Step 3: Shodan

- What open ports and running services did Shodan find:
	- Port 80 running Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine and Port 443 running the same.

### Step 5: Zenmap

Your client has asked that you help identify any vulnerabilities with their file-sharing server. Using the Metasploitable machine to act as your client's server, complete the following:

- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine: 
	- nmap -T4 -A -v 192.168.0.10
	
- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`:
	- nmap -T4 -A -v 192.168.0.10 -oN ~/Desktop/zenmapscan.txt
	
- Zenmap vulnerability script command: 
	- nmap -F --script smb-enum-shares 192.168.0.10
	
- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:
  1. What is the vulnerability:
	- The vulnerability is Samba, software used for file sharing and connecting to printers.  Here, it is specifically Samba 3.0.20.
	
  2. Why is it dangerous:
	- Using the Samba vulnerability, attackers can execute code in the root context even without authentication, which could easily be disastrous.  
	
  3. What mitigation strategies can you recommendations for the client to protect their server:
	1. Update Samba to a secure version (3.6.4 and up)
	OR
	2. Stop the service and close the 139/445 port
